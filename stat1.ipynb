    "# Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing data using numerical measures and graphical representations.\n",
    "# It aims to provide a clear and concise overview of the data at hand. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a) Measures of Central Tendency: Measures such as mean, median, and mode are used to describe the typical or central value of a dataset. \n",
    "# For instance, the mean income of a group of individuals or the median age of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b) Measures of Dispersion: Measures like range, variance, and standard deviation quantify the spread or variability in a dataset.\n",
    "# They help understand how much the data points deviate from the central tendency. \n",
